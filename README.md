# MergeSheets-openpyxl
Update master excel sheet with new data but with same column fields and sequence.
Eases your work when you have to copy and paste in discontinuos fashion and same file has been updated by several different people but at the same time so no two files have the updates of the other so can't simply copy paste the entire sheet to the other.
